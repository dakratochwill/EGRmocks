        <h1 class="text-center p-3 p-md-5">Virginia’s economy depends on a highly skilled technology workforce. The VCU College of Engineering provides it.<br>Here’s how:</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="grid align-items-center">
        <div class="grid-item order-1">
            <p class="number">1</p>

        <div class="grid-item order-2">
            <h2>We’re building Virginia’s workforce.</h2>
            <p>Ninety percent of VCU’s engineering students come from Virginia. Sure, Silicon Valley snags some of our graduates — but three quarters opt to make their careers in Virginia. And we reflect the <a href="https://egr.vcu.edu/about/diversity/">vibrant diversity</a> that is Virginia. VCU Engineering tops the national average for women engineering students, and we’re first in the state for Hispanic engineering students. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item order-3 order-md-4">
            <p class="number">2</p>

        <div class="grid-item order-4 order-md-3">
            <h2>We let undergraduates specialize early — in today’s most in-demand skills.</h2>
            <p>Virginia’s businesses need cybersecurity and data science talent immediately. That’s why <a href="https://egr.vcu.edu/academics/undergrad-degrees/">we created a program</a> to let our undergraduates specialize early in those skills. With this kind of concentrated training, VCU Engineering graduates show up workforce-ready. That means Ram Engineers spend less time in on-the-job training — and more time on the job. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item order-5">
            <p class="number">3</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item order-6">
            <h2>We prepare all students for the digital economy.</h2>
            <p>Computer science isn’t just for tech workers. It’s for all workers. At VCU, students can have a tech specialty without being tech majors. Any student can take four computer science electives to earn a <a href="https://egr.vcu.edu/departments/computer/academics/undergraduate/cs-fundamentals/">Fundamentals of Computing specialization</a> — plus a Greater Washington Partnership credential that gives them exclusive hiring advantages with participating companies.</p>

            <h2>We give Virginia’s economy exclusive access to our students (and they recruit them early).</h2>
            <p>When Ram Engineers graduate, Virginia’s employers are already familiar faces. At VCU’s <a href="https://ramhacks.vcu.edu">RamHacks</a>, businesses pitch real problems to student teams who spend 24 hours coding solutions. Think of it as an all-night tech interview. Our robust internship and co-op programs place our students in more than 90 businesses. And our new Tech Talent Internship Pipeline initiative is widening that pool even more with new summer internships in local companies.</p>

            <h2>We help Virginia’s tech professionals gain graduate-level training — without leaving the workforce.</h2>
            <p>Information technology professionals need advanced training. But businesses can’t afford to lose them to graduate school. VCU Engineering is solving this problem with <a href="https://egr.vcu.edu/departments/computer/academics/undergraduate/#certificates">post-baccalaureate graduate certificate</a> programs that give professionals a fast track to graduate-level training in cybersecurity and data science. We let those already in the industry stay on the job — and stay current (or gain fluency) in critical areas.</p>

            <p class="title">And we don’t wait until they’re in college.</p>
            <p>We also bring K-12 students into the field. Elementary school classes take real-time, virtual visits to explore technology wonders with our professors. And throughout the school year, high school students come to VCU Engineering to discover career opportunities, conduct real research in our labs — and show their stuff at our high school programming contests.</p>

            <h2>Case Study</h2>
            <h3>Brandon Watts, Class of 2018</h3>
            <p>Brandon Watts grew up in a household without the internet. Today, he’s a data engineer with one of Virginia’s Fortune 500 companies. Watts came to VCU as a math major — the first in his family to go to college. As a sophomore, he discovered computer science and was hooked. A dean’s list student, he completed a software engineering internship with CarMax as a junior and was recruited by the company after graduation. Watts designs and builds platforms to support CarMax enterprise analytics and drive business value. He regularly returns to VCU Engineering to share his expertise with students and recruit new talent to the company.</p>
